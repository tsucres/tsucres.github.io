### Who? What? Where? When?

I have a bachelor's degree in engineering from the Université Libre de Bruxelles and I'm currently doing a [master in computer science and engineering](http://www.ulb.ac.be/programme/en/MA-IRIF/index.html) in the same university which I expect to complete mid-2019.

I'm a long time passionate about software development & programming. I started learning C on my own when I was about 12. Since then I always wanted to learn more about software development and to build new things.

I am addicted to the satisfaction resulting from a code solving a specific problem in a clever, elegant and efficient way.


### Skills

I'm comfortable with C, C++, Python, Swift and javascript. I've also had the occasion to work with Java, PHP, Matlab and the most common web development technologies.


I'm familiar with the web development but what I enjoy the most is building software solutions using my favorite programming language and solving specific algorithmic and/or mathematical problems.

<!-- [polyvalence, good communication with other engineers], [how to be efficient and deal with deadlines]. 

My academic background taught me ... . It also taught me how to efficiently learn new concepts and to work with new technologies.-->

I'm also familiar with the most common design patterns and good programming practices. 


### Projects
