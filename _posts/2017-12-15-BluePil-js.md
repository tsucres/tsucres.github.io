BluePil.js is a (vanilla) javascript library allowing to easily make the images of a document load progressively, with a smooth animation. It actually mimics how the images are loaded on <a target="blanck" href="https://medium.com">Medium</a>.

<h3 style="text-align: center"><a href="https://github.com/tsucres/BluePil.js">DEMO</a></h3>


### Features

- Supports css background-images and img tags
- Dependency free
- Custom builds: bluepil can be built into different versions according to the needed functionalities.
- Supports all the relevant web browsers
- Customisable animations: the transition between the miniature image (placeholder) and the full image is completely customisable.


I wrote an article describing how it works. You can find it [here](/2017-12-01/Progressive-image-load.html) and on [Medium](...).

### Download

The library is available on [github](https://www.github.com/tsucres/BluePil.js), along with a "quick start guide" and the complete documentation.
