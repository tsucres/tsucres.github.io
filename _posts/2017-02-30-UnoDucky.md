The aim of this project was to build a USB Rubber Ducky using an Arduino Uno and the components present in the "Arduino Starter Kit". 

The main parts of this project are: 

1. the arduino circuit 
2. the arduino code (sketch) 
3. The ducky script encoder, written in Python.


The resulting "device" works like this: you copy the encoded ducky scripts on a micro SD card that you insert in the reader. When the arduino is plugged in a computer, it will let you choose the script you want to run. Then, the arduino will behave like a Rubber Ducky (i.e. like an automatic keyboard).


## Circuit

When assembled, it looks like this:

The LCD screen is used to show all the scripts found in the root of the SD card. The buttons allow to navigate through those files and select the script to run.

All the used components are in the official Arduino Starter Kit except for the SD card reader which I bought on [amazon](https://www.amazon.fr/gp/product/B01FRZVUH4/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).


## Sketch

The software running on the arduino is pretty simple. It reads the files from the SD card and let the user to select an encoded ducky script to run it.

An encoded ducky script contains the keys the arduino has to send on the host computer.

## The encoder

The encoder is a python script taking a ducky script as input and producing an encoded version of it. It also supports several keyboard layouts.

## Source code
The whole project (including source code, documentation and installation instructions) is on [github](https://github.com/tsucres/UnoDucky).

**Note**: The project was made for fun and doesn't intend to replace a Rubber Ducky. It's not really usable, just functional.
